## Implementation Details
For now i have created mockapiio link which return me list of pizzas in json structure. All user interaction with filters is handled at front end side only as i was not able to that logic at mockapi side but we can move the filters logic at backend side where in get call of list i will pass that lstFilters array from pizzaservice to api body and according to that api will return me the list.
If somehow you are unable to acces mocapi link you can use pizzalist.json present inside pizzamenu component folder for input.
